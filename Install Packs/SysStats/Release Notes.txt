Release Notes
=============

See the help available from the right-click context menu for more details.

Notes
=====
- Not everything works on ObjectDock (dropped files allegedly)
- Not everything works on AveDesk 1.1 or earlier (anything that requires dragging).
- There are no configs with this release (to keep it small). All existing configs
  will work. I will release showcase configs for all the new features over the coming
  weeks/months.
- The SDK will be updated sometime too.

Installing
==========
1. Quit all copies of AveDesk, ObjectDock and YzDock.
2. Unzip directly into your ObjectDock and/or AveDesk folder
   Make sure you replace *all* copies of SysStats.
3. Restart ObjectDock/AveDesk.

Support SysStats
================
SysStats has taken a huge chunk out of my life. Its been fun learning about Windows
development but I can't continue to devote this amount of time to it without a little
compensation (other than the enjoyment I get out of seeing it being used). If you would
like to see improvements to SysStats (and maybe a decent web-site to support it)
please consider donating some of your hard earned cash. You can find a link here:

New/Changed functionality
=========================
Controllers:
	This relase adds 'controllers' - a generalized way of interacting
	with a SysStats docklet/desklet. With controllers you can specify regions
	of a docklet/desklet that respond to various events such as a mouse event,
	a key press, a timer, files being dropped, the mouse hovering over a part of
	the desklet, a control being dragged etc.
	
	You can execute an application, change the appearance of the docklet,
	or execute a script.
	
	Specific controllers include:
	CursorController	Changes the appearance of the cursor
	DropTargetController	Accepts dropped files
	MappedController	Use this to implement slider controls of any shape (e.g. circular)
	MessageSender		Use this to convert one message type to another
	ValueSetter		Use this to set the value of a meter
	ScriptController	Executes a script in response to an event
	ASyncScriptController	Executes a script in the background
	Shortcut		Executes an application
	TimerController		Sends a windows message at regular intervals

New Meters
	- An animation meter used to control overlay animations
	- A MAPI mailcheck meter
	- ASycnhronous script meter

New Overlays
	- A scroller overlay (controlled by an animation meter)
	- An animator overlay that implements 'in-betweening'
	  (you can use this to implement 'drawers')
	- Animated images (in combination with an AnimationMeter).
	- A 'mapped' image overlay that can be used to change the shape of an image
	  according to the value of a meter.

Integration with AveDesk 1.2:
	- Added an AveDesk 1.2 hack to allow a user to create a new config by selecting the
  	  skin called '_New' from the list.
	- Improved windows message handling
	- Integrated SysStats config browsing into 'add desklet' dialog.
	- Added support to navigate to SysStats object model from AveDesk
	  object model. i.e. you can get to the SysStatsModel object from
	  an AveDesk script. As an example, you can contol the AeroWeather
	  widget using the included script 'aeroweather.vbs'.
	- Integrated with AveDesk desklet show/hide
	- Fixed missing 'Properties' window
	
General Improvements:
	- Uses less CPU
	- Added hue and saturation controls to image and mapped overlays
	- Added 'Help' button to configuration dialog, since that's where
	  it is most useful.
	- Dialogs no longer hog the limelight :)
	- Any overlay can now act as a mask for any other overlay.
	- Can scale the whole desklet for AveDesk
	- Can access items by name in scripts
	- Help documentation is much improved.
	- Plugins are now automatically loaded without having to restart.
	- Plugins are now versioned.

Improved XML Meter:
	- Added extra method to XML meter to allow scripts to access nodelists
	- The XML meter can now use full XPath expressions
  
Improved Localalization:
	- Fractional update times for meters now work in all locales.
	- Time meter display now uses current locale properly (i.e. French in France
	  English in England, etc. etc.)
	- In fact all meters now support current locale (e.g. ',' for decimal points).
	- Time meter now supports timezones
	
Improved Text Overlay:
	- Added text wrapping
	- Added alternate text rendering that includes control over antialiasing
	- Easier to create outlined text (can set blur color separately from font color).
	
Improved Scripting
	- SysStats now emulates some of the features found in the WScript object
	  such as 'ConnectObject()' and 'Echo()'.
	- There is now a script console for each script that can be used to help
	  debugging.

Bug Fixes
	- Fixed a lot of memory problems
	- PDH meter dialogs no longer give the message 'Can't connect to machine'.
	- Relative pathnames are now always computed correctly.
	- SysStats no longer crashes on a dual CPU machine when a docklet is destroyed.
	- Works on W2K (yay).
	- XML meter should work on just about everything.
