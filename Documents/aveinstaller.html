<h1>AveInstaller </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>AveInstaller (for lack of a better name) is an integrated desklet / skin / 
  whatever installer in AveDesk 1.2. The installer is able to automatically unzip 
  <i>zipped</i> files and to put the files in the right place. To do this, the 
  ZIP-file must be specially prepared: it must not be password-protected and, 
  more important, must include the file <b>avedesk_installer.xml</b> inside the 
  ZIP file. This XML-file contains information about where to place files, requirements 
  to install and actions to perform</p>
<h2><br>
  avedesk_installer.xml</h2>
<p>This file contains all the information needed by the AveInstaller. It's a standard 
  XML-file and must start with an <b>AveInstaller</b> node. There are also six 
  mandatory sections/childnodes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>About </li>
  <li>Requirements</li>
  <li>BeforeCopy</li>
  <li>CopyInformation</li>
  <li>AfterCopy</li>
  <li>AfterCopyFailed</li>
</ul>
<p>The flow of operation is determined by these five of the six sections; the 
  About section is only for informational purposes. In text, the flow of operation 
  is described as:<br>
  <b>If</b> all <i>Requirements</i> are met, <b>then</b> the <i>BeforeCopy</i> 
  actions are invoked <b>and</b> the <i>CopyInformation</i> is used to copy files 
  from the ZIP-file. <b>If</b> copying the files was <b>succesfull</b>, <b>then 
  </b>the <i>AfterCopy</i> actions are invoked, <b>else</b> the <i>AfterCopyFailed</i> 
  actions are invoked. <br>
  <br>
  In a pseudo programming-language, this is described as:<br>
  
<pre><font facename="Courier New">
<b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">if</font></b><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">( AreMet(Requirements) )
{
	DoActions (BeforeCopy);
	<b>if</b>( CopiedSuccessFully (CopyInformation) )
 	{
		DoActions (AfterCopy);
	}
	<b>else</b>
	{
		DoActions (AfterCopyFailed);
	}
}</font>
 </font></pre>
<h3>About section</h3>
<p>The About section is a simple section that provides some basic information 
  about the files to install. It's childnodes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Author</b> , the name of the author of this package.</li>
  <li><b>Email</b> , (optional) the e-mail address of the author.</li>
  <li><b>HomePage</b> , (optional) the homepage of the author.</li>
  <li><b>Version</b> , the version of the file(s) to install.</li>
  <li><b>Description</b> , a basic description of the file(s) to install.</li>
  <li><b>URL</b> , (optional) the URL where this package was offered for download.</li>
  <li><b>GUID </b>, (optional) a GUID of this package. - Might be used for in 
    future for automatical downloads maybe.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Requirements section</h3>
<p>The Requirements sections contains requirements that must be met before the 
  installation of the files will actually start. If one of the requirements in 
  this section is not met, the installation will fail immediately.</p>
<p>Each requirement is added to this section as a childnode with the name <b>Item</b>. 
  Furthermore, each item must have a <b>Type</b> attribute which determines the 
  type of requirement. The following Types are currently implemented in <i>AveDesk 
  1.2</i> : </p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="19%"><b>Type</b></td>
    <td width="20%"><b> Minimal installer version</b></td>
    <td width="61%"><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="19%">RequiredAveDeskVersion</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="61%">Will succeed if the installed AveDesk version is equal to 
      or higher than the version in this Item.<br>
      The required version must be described in the node's <b>text</b> in the 
      Major.Minor format. <br>
      Example:<br>
      &lt;Item Type=&quot;RequiredAveDeskVersion&quot;&gt;1.2&lt;/Item&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="19%">RequiredInstallerVersion</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="61%">Will succeed if the Installer version is equal to or higher 
      than the version in this Item.<br>
      The required version must be described in the node's <b>text</b> in the 
      Major.Minor format. <br>
      Example:<br>
      &lt;Item Type=&quot;RequiredInstallerVersion&quot;&gt;1.2&lt;/Item&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="19%">AcceptText</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="61%">Will succeed if the user accepts the text. The text must be 
      in a child node with the name Text.<br>
      Example:<br>
      &lt;Item Type=&quot;AcceptText&quot;&gt;<br>
      &lt;Text&gt;You need to accept this text. Accept?&lt;/Text&gt;<br>
      &lt;/Item&gt; </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="19%">FileExists</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="61%">Will succeed if the file that is described in this node, exists. 
      The file must be described in terms of a File/Directory node structure. 
      It's possible to check for more files by simply describing them too in the 
      File/Directory node structure.<br>
      Example:<br>
      &lt;Item Type=&quot;FileExists&quot;&gt;<br>
      &lt;Directory BaseFolder=&quot;Desklets&quot;&gt;<br>
      &lt;Directory Name=&quot;Puzzle&quot;&gt;<br>
      &lt;File&gt;puzzle.dll&lt;/File&gt;<br>
      &lt;/Directory&gt;<br>
      &lt;/Directory&gt; <br>
      &lt;/Item&gt; </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="19%">Not</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="61%"> 
      <p>This will succeed if the requirement included in this node does <b>not</b> 
        succeed. THe included requirement must be a childnode with the name <b>Item</b> 
        inside this node.<br>
        Example:<br>
        &lt;!-- checks if Desklets\Puzzle\puzzle.dll does not already exists --&gt;<br>
        &lt;Item Type=&quot;Not&quot;&gt;<br>
        &lt;Item Type=&quot;FileExists&quot;&gt;<br>
        &lt;Directory BaseFolder=&quot;Desklets&quot;&gt;<br>
        &lt;Directory Name=&quot;Puzzle&quot;&gt;<br>
        &lt;File&gt;puzzle.dll&lt;/File&gt;<br>
        &lt;/Directory&gt;<br>
        &lt;/Directory&gt; <br>
        &lt;/Item&gt;<br>
        &lt;/Item&gt; </p>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h4>OnError sub-sections</h4>
<p>Each Requirement item can have an (optional) OnError sub-node. This will give 
  the author an opportunity to have more detailed error-messages or even giving 
  the Installer the possibility to recover from the error. For example, if a ZIP 
  files contains a skin for the Puzzle desklet, the author can have the existence 
  of the puzzle desklet as a requirement. In the OnError of the requirement-item, 
  he will be able to give a download-URL to the puzzle desklet, so the installer 
  can automatically download and install this desklet if it's not already installed.<br>
  The OnError node can have the following optional childnodes:
<ul>
  <li><b>Message</b> , a message to display if the requirement failes</li>
  <li><b>URL</b> , a URL where a package can be downloaded to 'fix' this requirement.</li>
  <li><b>HomePage</b> , a homepage where the user can manually download or find 
    information about the requirement.</li>
  <li><b>GUID</b> , a GUID which can be used in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Actions (BeforeCopy, AfterCopy, AfterCopyFailed)</h3>
<p>The BeforyCopy, AfterCopy and AfterCopyFailed subsections are all the same 
  type of section: they invoke actions. The difference between them is the time 
  when those actions are involved:<br>
  BeforyCopy's actions are invoked before the files are actually copied, but after 
  the requirements where checked (and passed).<br>
  AfterCopy's actions are invoked if copying the files was successfully.<br>
  AfterCopyFailed's actions are invoked if copying the files was NOT successfull.<br>
  <br>
  Each of those sections can include multiple actions. Each action is listed under 
  an <i>childnode</i> with the name <b>Item</b>. The <b>Type</b>-attribute of 
  each of the Item-childnodes specify the type of action. This is a similiar system 
  like the requirements section. <br>
  The following action-Types are currently implemented in <i>AveDesk 1.2</i>:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="17%"><b>Type</b></td>
    <td width="20%"><b>Minimal installer version</b></td>
    <td width="63%"><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="17%">ShowBitmap</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="63%">This will show a bitmap file (PNG, BMP, GIF, JPG) file as 
      a splashscreen. The filename of the bitmap to use is relative to the ZIP-file's 
      root and must be given as the text of the item-node.<br>
      Example:<br>
      &lt;Item Type=&quot;ShowBitmap&quot;&gt;About.png&lt;/Item&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="17%">LoadDesklet</td>
    <td width="20%">1.2</td>
    <td width="63%">This will load a desklet from a config file. The config file 
      must be embedded into the Item-node as a childnode. Since AveDesk1.2's config 
      files are XML files to, this can simply be copy-pasted into the installers 
      XML file.<br>
      Example ommited for brevity.</td>
